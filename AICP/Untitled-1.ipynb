      "{'Speaker_1': \"International political context. These factors cannot be overlooked, but we must not risk falling into in action and lose hope. Instead of this, we should all invite the situation, commit to shouldering our collective responsibility, working together with an awareness of the urgency required in addressing the threat posed by space systems, as I pointed out at the beginning of this process, I am convinced that we will not be able to make. Progress. If we see this process as a struggle between different groups and interests, it's not a matter of West versus ES versus South versus north. Rather, this is a global issue because in some way or another, it affects all countries. And all persons that is particularly important to under score, with this in mind, despite the pessimism shown amongst many, we have seen constructive and interactive discussions at past sessions with participation from delegations from all regions and development levels in the space sphere. I heard that this session will also be productive and that we will be able to make progress towards the next stage when we will beginning our work on agreements on recommendations for the General Assembly. We know that the work of this group does not represent a panacea in order to resolve all space security issues, but I am convinced that it can be a significant step against a broader background of our multilateral efforts. In this area, at the end of this session, we will be able to have more clarity as to the real possibility of concluding our mandate. As we commemorate the negotiation of the Outer Space Treaty, the broad and enthusiastic participation of delegations both in our discussions and through working groups, as well as the valuable contributions made by civil society. Organizations will all allow us to maintain the hope that we will be able to reach our objective. I thank you. Thank you, chairman. Allow me to thank you for your proposal for leading the work of this session, which sees us reaching A crucial moment in our work where we need to progress on preparing. Standards pursuant to resolution_76231, as you mentioned. I repeat that we support your approach and your provisional timetable, which enables us to link work with the work back with the work of this second session. Secondly, I turn to the participation by observers. We must observe the rules and practices of the GA resolution_7623. One setting up this group is clear. It allows for the participation of non governmental organisations and other entities that have received a standing invitation to participate as GA observers, and it is our hope that this practice and this rule can be observed here. I thank you. Presidio, thank you, chairman. At the outset, we would like to echo other delegations in thanking you for your efforts. And the way in which you have prepared our work. With regard to the various issues raised here this morning concerning substantive questions or with regard to the indicative work programme, we would like to thank you for preparing and circulating the timetable. Prior to this meeting, this work plan will enable us to structure our work this week. And to be as productive as possible. We consider this work plan to offer the sufficient flexibility to enable all delegations to raise issues and questions they deem to be important. We hope that we will be in a position to make use of this work programme. Particularly bearing in the mind that our delegation, as I dare say, is the case for many others, has prepared for this meeting on the basis of that document. Of course, adaptation is possible if that could facilitate our work, but we hope that this document will ultimately serve as guidance for us in our endeavours this week with regard to the second issue that. Of participation. Organizations enjoying a standing invitation. Pursuant to the General Assembly resolution, we would like to support the statements made by a number of delegations, the rules applicable to organisations that ensure standing observer status are quite clear cut cut. This participation is ensuring directly in the resolution establishing the working group. If organisations are invited to participate in the work. The term participation clearly means that on the basis of establishing developed practice, they have the right to take the floor, we feel it is essential. To avoid establishing any form of precedent in our work that would contradict or undermine that clearly established rule. We do support the approach that you have set out in which you intend to follow. On this matter. And as we heard from you in your opening remarks this morning, I thank you. To give the floor to the distinguished representative of Mexico, you have the floor, dear colleague. Thank you very much, chairman. Firstly, allow me to welcome you to Geneva and. Thank you for your contribution to the previous sessions. We will be brief. We believe it's important to get down to the substantive matters as soon as possible and avoid long drawn out procedural discussions which divert us from our task. We would like to thank you and the secretariat for circulating the indicative work programme my delegation. Into this that this program will enable us to order our work, we consider it that it also offers an opportunity to enable the positions of all delegations to be considered. With potential critical approaches to all of those and the search for interactions between them which will possibly enable countries to bring their positions closer together with regard to observer participation by delegation, led to echo all those who have spoken already with regard to the need to respect the. Rule and practice of the General Assembly on this topic. As one was operated paragraph_6, all of resolution a res_76231. Specifically, the fact that observers may make both written and oral contribution in the course of informal and formal sessions of this group. We echo the points made by the United Kingdom, Austria and others to the effect that there is a need to be particular respect to the special status of the ICRC. Lastly, as Brazil indicated. This is not just for procedural matters, but also to ensure that the significant substantial points that could be made by such bodies can be truly headed for the chair. I think the distinguished Mexican representative for their contribution. Treatment motion. I would now like to give the floor to the distinguished representative of Cuba. You have the floor. Thank you, chairman. This is the first time we've taken the floor and we are therefore like to. Express our support. For you, you can count on Cuban delegation as we engage in our substantive work. We would like. To echo many of the delegations, we've spoken in saying that this is a crucial moment as that you have said, we have to focus on a fruitful. Debate that can assist in coming up with the final report. The indicative programme should set that end. We appreciate. Sheet the concern around the fact that certain topics may not all contribute to the same extent or may not necessarily or be equally effective in terms of reaching A consensus by the end of the fourth session. We consider that flexibility should come to the fore with regard to 6C in of the. Year resolution_76231 and thank you. The chair. I thank the distinguished representative Hubert for her statements. Chris. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, we entirely agree that flexibility should be shown by delegations. This flexibility should be comprehensive. It should be across the board. It should not. Be some. One sided factor in the discussions in this group and this connection when it comes to the organization of the work and the timetable, we understand that. This document will be an official document and unofficial document to be used for guidance, but as we understand it, you chair will be following it. And will be proposing the discussion of those topics that are included in that document if you consider. To that, there's a way of the organising the work in a more effective way that we would not necessarily oppose it, but we would ask you. Off to topic #3. And allow for a specific time slot for discussion of the two separate topics that our delegation would like to discuss separately as separate topics that you would propose for discussion in the document. And that would mean. Allocating time. Equal time. In comparison with the other topics, to avoid any potential discrimination for discussion of the the prevention of placement of weapons at the space. Norms, rules, and principles for the prevention of placement of weapons allowed to space. That's one separate issue. It could be question_4. That would be at our request for separate discussion and then after that as question_5. Also, as a separate two as slot as a minimum. If not, more discussion of the issue of function of the use of threat of force against space objects. In that case, this document could certainly say. As guidance, where on a balanced non discriminatory basis, the different priorities of states could be discussed into area. Are two key priorities which we consider should be separately discussed within this working group? If that is not the case. We do not see the need for this type of detailed document it. Could potentially. When the delegates work more difficult, therefore, chair, if we're talking about allocating specific time flights for specific issues, then those two time slots need to be included. That is clear for us. If that is not the case. We would call for not allocating time slots for specific issues in this way with regard to non governmental bodies, we. Take on board what you said, chair. But here, since we find ourselves. In a discussion of organizational matters. Between delegates and the states on specific proposals made by you to make it possible for non governmental entities to make statements in official plenary sittings, we firstly consider. That this discussion. Refers need needs for us to achieve first to inform those consensus with a decision to be taken as to whether non governmental entities can speak in official settings such consensus. Our decision has not yet been achieved and cannot be. It does not distinguish chair required decision from your side. It does not fall in your limit. It is an issue for discussion by delegations reporting representing Member States. Who should come up with that decision on the basis of the well known consensus principle on the participation of non governmental entities in? Official planner. It just needs to enjoy consensus.  Guess what? I have to download? As we have said, the issue of the existing practice is very, very subjective. Certain delegations have different views of this and in this connection we would like. Ultimately, to understand what to sum up as follows in view of the absence of consensus on your proposal for non government entities to take the floor in a formal lease, then we would call for such statements not to be made. Bearing in mind. That fact. In view of the the the understanding to the working methods of this group. How the following understanding of this morning's? Discussion there is an absence of consensus on the questions issue with regard to non government entities. And as such, they are not entitled in the course of the full fineries to make statements, they may make a contribution in writing and also in statement in the course of informal segments. That may, if necessary, be organised by you, Mr. Chairman. This is our understanding of the situation. If it is incorrect, can kindly set us right that there is a need within this room for there to be a clear common understanding as to how the work is going to be organised in this third session. If that is not the case, we believe that it will be. Difficult at this stage to move to substantive issues until a single understanding of the organizational matters of the third session of the group can be reached. I thank you for your attention. Thank you, Chairman, you are right, that is our proposal to include topic_4. Norms, rules and principles relating. And then topic_5. Palavra and give the floor to the representative of Cuba. Thank you. We will be brief. We would not want to be an obstacle to the system to work. I simply want to indicate that this document, either for this guidance will be guided our discussions and as such there may be an impact in the drafting of the final. Document we should reiterate that both the placement of weapons, outer space and the threat of use, or the use of such weapons are two of the threats that medications identified, including Cuba. If they are important topics that should be considered on their merits. And of course, our delegation will take the opportunity to raise at various points in the discussions. I thank you. I thank the distinguished representative Cuba, for that statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your clarification with regard to the first issue, we have a point of clarification for you. Have we understood correctly that? The issues proposed by us will be included. As new topics_4:00 and_5:00. In your document, the guidance document providing A timetable or proposed timetable for this session. If that's the case, have we understood correctly that the time for discussion of those issues? Will be allocated on Wednesday the 1st of February. In the first and second halves of the day, if we are mistaken here, could you kindly then explain? Those two issues will be discussed and in addition. As we've understood it. In that case, there would be. A need for a second version of this document to be published with these topics reflected in it, so that all delegations could have the same guidance documents for this third session. That would be absolutely correct in view of the addition of the two new topics, so that everybody. Clearly understand when they need to be ready to discuss these issues and when those discussions will be taking place, albeit on a on a. Guidance bases only turn to the second question chair. We consider. That to noting the situation as it stands, as we have said. Before moving to the substantive part of the discussion. This question does not touch on the mandate of the group. It's absolutely clear to us this is simply a matter of the interpretation of the. Existing practice, which has been interpreted in different. Ways by different. Delegations, we would like to clearly once again say that we do not in this room seek consensus when it comes to this issue. At least uh delegation wishes to once again set out its clear cut position on this and make clear that we see an absence of consensus in the room on the. Issue the group has not taken this decision. We do not consider that there is a single understanding in relation to how this aspect of the mandate of the group the. Plays out. If you recall, chair we. Raise this issue. As an unresolved one, and at the organizational stage, but it never led to any consensus as to what established practice was and how the work of non governmental entities would in fact be organised in terms of. Formal plenary sitting. This is an open question and there is still no consensus on it. That is quite clear to us. We need to appreciate that fact that needs to be duly recorded as absence of a consensus on this issue as to how. Organizations and government organisations may be involved in formal plenary sittings and then move on as soon as possible we. See no other approach. We do not want to continue going round in circles, but we will not hesitate to reiterate our clear cut position. But to let us not to allow ourselves to get lost in rhetoric on this is. To you, we see no point in that. Therefore, once again, we propose taking note of the absence of consensus on this issue. Noting that consensus is absent and moving onto the substantive issue of the group, let us not waste time on this further. This is a very important discussion. In terms of setting the organizational agenda of the third session, this is very important for our delegation, but when we do not consider it time lost to discuss it, it is important to spend our time setting the scene for the constructive work ahead. To enable us to reach consensus with the outcome document, if that's not the case, we will be complicating our lives since this issue will. Have ramifications for the work of the group, so let us therefore decide on these proposed_2 proposals that have been made and move on to the discussion of substantive issues. What is absolutely clear as day for us is that we now need to move to that. And to this. Question with a clear single understanding on the two points amongst all delegations here in the room. So that that can be duly noted and that we don't hear any further questions from delegations as to. Different interpretations when it comes to discussion of the organizational matters for the third session of the OWGI. Thank you. Mr. President, thank you, chairman. We had a question for you. We would be grateful for your reply. When are you proposing the discussion on these two questions? What day? At what time in that day do you plan to allocate time for discussion of those questions? We would like to clearly understand that. Before we are in a position to agree on how this is going to be arranged, could you kindly clarify that question? Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman, for that clarification. Are not in any way opposed to that way of dealing with the issue. We of course understand. That we might need to give over time to other discussions reduce time on certain topics to make time for others, but we just do want to see in the renewed version of the guidance timetable. That all of the topics included in this document can be allocated exactly the same amount of time. If it's an hour and a half for each one, that's fine. Let it be an hour and a half for all of the topics included in the document. It's important not to give the impression that some topics are more important to have greater priority than others in this timetable. Therefore, if we're talking about guidance time, for example. Tomorrow, in the early afternoon or mid midday, that could be fine. That let us make sure that the time allocated is appropriate discussion of those two topics. As we already said. We look forward to receiving a new draft, Mr. Chair of this. Indicative timetable with these two topics included with specific dates and times for the discussion. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, we are delighted to hear that we are gradually making progress on organizational discussions for the third session. Of the working group. We are. Delighted to note that you have resolved the issue around the indicative timetable and the questions to be included and discussed separately in the course of discussion with time given over that we are grateful to other delegations for their willingness to discuss those. With regard to the second matter chair, we would like to clearly hear. The understanding of the room with regard to the possible participation of the non governmental entities in the course of formal plenary site. Things we once again repeat our position to the effect that we do not consider this possible. We do not consider this established practice of affiliated structures of the UN General Assembly across the board. Practice varies across these different bodies. And in that connection, we do not consider that there is consensus on this topic within the working group. We once again under score that this does not establish precedent for any other affiliated groups of the GA. Or indeed, the practice is sitting to the General Assembly itself, nor in any way does it have any influence on the rule procedure of the GA, since this issue is a matter for the Rules of Procedure of the GA, and it is quite comprehensive and general. And character and. Contains quite general wording. Not necessarily specifically connected to the participation of the certain permanent observer organisations in affiliated groups of the General Assembly, nor does it touch on the specific section of resolution_76231. In addition, as I said, we need to understand that this is a resolution with the recommendatory character rather than consensus character delegations, including Russian delegation, spoke against that resolution. Including the paragraph which in question. There is a paragraph you've never to the organization session and that it called for the need to. Discuss and decide on procedural matters. This includes the participation of non governmental entities in formal plenaries. This is something that needs to be worked upon, leading to a consensus decision of all states participating in the group all delegations. We therefore consider chair that. The proposal with regard to statements to be delivered by. Such entities as yet to be reached, we have spent an awful lot of time on this issue. There is a need to realize the absence of consensus and take note of that before we move on to substantive issues, as we said. This situation that pertains needs to be recognised such that the room can be clear, have a single understanding of the state of affairs before we can move on to avoid any difference of interpretation or misunderstanding around this issue if states. Are not ready to take note of and record the absence of consensus and move. On on the basis of a single understanding of this issue, we consider that it would be difficult to move at this stage to our substantive work until that single understanding of the state of affairs can be reached. Thank you. Thank you very much, chairman. It's not necessary to set out our position anymore clearly on this, but firstly. Is connected with the Interstate character of the group and we would like to under score that. This is an intergovernmental Interstate body and it works on the basis of consensus. If a delegation raises any issue for consideration by this group, that needs discussion with the decision to be taken. Which can be done or not done. Therefore, discussion of this issue in and of itself is of value and does not run counter to what has been decided. If it is something which has been raised. By a member of the group itself. So. We have at least one delegation with serious doubts as to this question. And has its particular points of view on that. That means that the issue needs to be resolved. If that is not possible. We can take note of the absence of a decision taken on that and as such, the absence of any mandate to take steps on the basis of that, or we can pursue the discussion further. We do not see any other possibilities. As has been said already. This issue needs to be resolved before we move on to substantive work, since a failure to do so. From an organizational standpoint, our work will be complicated. We do not share the interpretation to the effect. That this position in any way calls into doubt. Established practice in the General Assembly. It's simply about different interpretation of established practice by different delegations, and specifically with regard to specific expert affiliated groups working under the auspices of. The General Assembly. And specifically this open-ended working group. As I already said, established practice changes over the years. There may be different established practices used in different context. For example, for many years there is the practice. Of such statement not being made and we're not following that, maybe we could be further. I would like to under score that this does not in any way change any practices within the General Assembly itself, nor does it alter the Rules of Procedure. Nor will such a decision have any influence on the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly or practices of the GA Plenaries as as as was said. It will also not set a present for the future or for other similar affiliated structures. It's about the EWG. Specifically, this is a specific issue. In terms of the participation of the non government entities, as we said, there is an absence of consensus as it stands. We can either take note of the absence of consensus and move to substantive issues, or chair if you feel it's necessary to continue the discussion of this matter, we can do so, but as I said. We consider that it will be difficult for us. To take any other position from our side from that that we have voiced on numerous occasions thus far. A constructive approach would be to. Take note of this position and move on with the. Substantive work in order to make constructive contributions to preparing the outcome document of the working group. With the sufficient time to be given to the substantive issues for discussion at this third session, unfortunately we do not see any other options. We feel that is the most appropriate approach to be taken in view of this situation as it stands in view. Of the positions that have been set forth by Member States. There could be a lengthy discussion of the mandate of the group and established practice, but the fact is that the delegation of the Russian Federation considers the mandate of the open-ended working group as absolutely clear cut. This is a national position. Of our state in addition. We considered the understanding of established practice as absolutely in a naturally clear cut way. We intend to honour that position. Accept it as a fact of life and bear that in and we call for that to be borne in mind and for the working group work to be continued. A common understanding in the room that there's an absence of consensus on the participation of. Non government entities in plenary settings. Particular bearing in mind that a number of delegations have not voiced their opinion and on that basis. We call it the fact that consensus is lacking. You are, of course, entitled chair to record the state of affairs as it pertains in the room. Seeing to it that that fact be reflected in the outcome document of the working group, as I said, a fact of life, in order to indicate that on the basis of that situation.  You would be going to. Non government, non governmental entities would not be entitled to make oral statements in the course of formal plenary sittings we can see that that would. Be an optimal approach? So that when we come back after lunch, we can move on to discussion of substantive issues in this third session of the working group. Thank you. \", 'Speaker_2': \"I appreciate the active engagement of all delegations during the intercessional period. In particular, I wish to express my appreciation to all those groups and delegations that took up my open invitation to consult ahead of our session this week. I also wish to express my appreciation to those delegations that prepared working papers for our present. For my own part, in October, I participated in the joint panel discussion of the 1st and 4th committees of the General Assembly, the Co Chair summary of that meeting was circulated earlier this month to the permanent missions in New York. I have spoken at various events on the work of this OEWGI would not like to make an exhaustive list of all the events that I have been invited to participate. But it has been very active and and and I I thank all the organisations that have invited me. On 25th of January, in accordance with paragraph six of General Assembly resolution, 76/231I participated in an international consultative meeting with interested representatives of commercial actors and civil society, which was Co organized by Unidir and. You know that. I believe the item we are addressing at this third session reflects the most critical part of our mandate. Therefore, it is my intention to devote the maximum amount of time during this session to consideration of agenda item 6C. At the same time, I recognize that if we leave the matter of preparing the report. Only through our final session, we may run out of time to give it the full consideration it may require in light of the richness of the discussions. We have had so. As I indicated at the end of our second session, to assist allegations as we move after this session toward the final phase of our work, I have prepared the paper containing possible elements on item 6A and 6B of our agenda. The paper, which is under my sole authority. Reflects a non exhaustive set of elements drawn from the statements and working papers of states participating in this open-ended working. This paper is without prejudice to the preparation and adoption of the report of the working group to be submitted to the General Assembly at its 78th session. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that the the this elements paper does not constitute the first draft of the report. The report will be drafted. To all of us. In light of our need to make use of our time this week on agenda item 6C, I have requested to receive preliminary written feedback on the possible elements by Monday 20th of February. I look forward to discussing the way ahead on the preparation of our report at the end of our session. This intersectional part of our work is going to be extremely important at this stage, Excellencies distinguished. Before we initiate our substantive discussions, I wish to recall the modalities for our work that have been previously decided. This group is established pursuant to General Assembly Resolution_76/231 entitled Reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours. Which provides the mandate for our work. You may recall that in accordance with operative paragraph six of solution_76 Slash_231 and organizational session of the OEWG was held in Geneva on 7th and 9th of February_22. Little at which we reached agreement on number of issues, in particular the group adopted their agenda as now contained in its document, A/AC294/2022/2. The group affirmed the applicability, mutatis mutandis of the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations. General Assembly to this body and that all decisions by the group shall be taken on the basis of consensus by the United Nations Member States. The group affirmed that other international organizations, commercial actors and civil society, as referred to in paragraph six of Resolution_76/231, will be able to attend the public plenary meetings of the group as observers and may provide written contributions on matters under consideration. The group, which will be made available at no cost to the organization pursuant to the established practice, the Chair. Undertook to provide the group with a list of the entities with consultative status with the economic and Social Council for information and a list of all other relevant organizations and commercial actors for consideration on a non objection basis. These lists are now available at the back of the conference room. Excellencies distinguished delegates. We have one outstanding organizational matter related to our work as a whole. You will recall that due to discrepancies in the different language versions of Resolution_76/231, there were different interpretations of how many sessions were mandated to the group. To clarify this matter, the General Assembly subsequently decided on the dates for the four sessions of the group. Unless the group decides otherwise. That decision is recorded under simple_76/561 and contained in document A/76/49 volume_3. Based on the original information made available by the secretariat, the 4th session of the group was scheduled from 7th to 11th of August_2023 at the Center Internet. The CIC G Santo International de Conference, Geneva. I have also been informed that the parties to the Treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons, the first prep come of the amputee. Has decided to hold the first session for the Ninth Review Conference from the 31st of July to the 11th of August in Vienna. Accordingly, it is my intention to propose that the group decide in accordance with the section_76/561 of the General Assembly, to hold its fourth session from. The 14th to the 18th of August in Room_16. This will enable the group to meet in a room that ensures all interested delegations can participate and avoid overlap with the NPT meeting. I do not propose to take a decision. On this now. In case any delegation requires time to consider this matter, I intend to return to this matter not later than Thursday morning. Let's now turn to the organization of the work of this week's third session of the OEWG. Our work this week will focus on agenda item 6C to make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by states to space systems, including, as appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including. And the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Following the practice of the first two sessions, I would now like to draw your attention to the indicative timetable of the third session, which was circulated by the secretariat on Friday 27th of January, with the symbol A/AC294/2023 slash IMF. One slash Rev_11. One Rev. One, I would like to remind you that the indicative timetable is not a formal program of work, but a flexible to. To facilitate delegations preparations for the meeting and to encourage a well structured, interactive dialogue, the times. On the program are merely indicative, and the best guess. Of the chair as to how much time we may need to devote to each one of the topics. No panels have been organized for this session. As you can see, in order to maximize the time available for what should hopefully be an interactive discussion among Member States at the beginning of each topic, any delegation. That may have prepared working papers with elements that are relevant to the matter at hand are strongly encouraged to request the floor early to present their proposals and views. All the other delegations are also encouraged to participate in a very interactive discussion, reacting to these proposals and presentations in accordance with General Assembly Resolution_76/231. As I already mentioned, intergovernmental organizations and other entities having received the standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly as well as organizations and bodies of the United Nations, will also be encouraged to participate in this. It is my intention to give the floor following the last intervention by Member States on the current topic or item to any governmental organization and other entities having received the standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly. In addition, following the practice of the 1st. Two sessions it is my intention to allow representatives of commercial actors and civil society to request the floor and make all statements in an informal setting at the end of our formal discussion on each topic, time permitting and on a non objection basis. Now we will start with agenda item 6C to make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles. I have a request for the floor by the distinguished representative of the Russian delegation. You have the floor, Sir. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his. Are there any other speakers that would like to to comment on the indicative timetable or organizational issues before we move on?  United Kingdom.

Yes, the distinguished representative of Iran. You have the floor, Sir. The distinguished oversensitive of Iran for this intervention as a matter of fact, you are not the last speaker there. There are more speakers that have requested the floor, and in that regard I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished perspective of the Philippines. I thank the distinguished representative of the Philippines for his statement. I would like to ask delegations now whether there is any other delegation that would like to make a statement on before we we start with, with the substantial discussion.  Russian Federation. The distinguished representative of the Russian Federation has the floor. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and now I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished representative of of Denmark. You have the floor, Madam. I thank the distinguished representative of Denmark for her statement, and now I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished representative of Canada. You have the floor, Madam. I thank the distinguished Representative of Canada for her. Seems to be the case, so I would like to to make a brief reaction to the to the comments and statements of delegations. Regarding the indicative timetable, as I have pointed out in in my introductory remarks and also as understood by the allegations. This is just the proposal. In order to to have a structure, it is in our discussions. It is not an official program of work. If it was an official program of work, we would have to officially adopt it and that would take up a whole session. As you all know. We don't want that. We want to start our substantial. Discussion so because of this I have proposed this structure. And so far this. Method of work has has given good a good result in previous sessions and in in this regard. I appreciate the the support for this proposal by most allegations and I would like to reiterate and emphasize that the if there is any issue that is not included. Any delegation is is obviously has the right to to to raise any issue. To follow the structure is only to to, to facilitate and make a good use of our limited time. But that set, of course, every day, any delegation may raise any other issue, and flexibility is_1 concept that has been repeatedly mentioned in in, in. The interventions. This is what it is about. It is flexible, fully flexible and regarding the time rule this is just a guess of how how much time we we will need for any of the issues. But we we need to adapt to, to to the interests that the delegates may have to to address any of these issues. Now regarding the second issue that has been mentioned regarding the the participation of the observers from non governmental organizations, my intention is to fully apply. The Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly and established practice. As clearly established in the in in the mandate of resolution_76231, it is true that in the last session. I have accepted one proposal to allow one observer organization to speak in an informal setting, but in doing so I need to remind allegations that I did make myself clear that this was an exceptional decision. That should not set a precedent at all. I would not like to spend anymore time discussing this issue. We have had a very long and intense discussion on organizational procedural matters in our session in general in in February of last year. So I think that the I I would not like to go as far as having to make a ruling on this in this regard. Some delegations have met. That we are based on consensus, that is true. But we consensus does not mean that we can not take into account the the mandate that we have. We have a mandate and the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly are not up to the to discussion we we need to apply them and establish practice, so if necessary. I I am going to make a ruling on in on this but I don't want to spend any more time discussing this is. I have a. Request from the floor from the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. Thank you for your request of the floor and I I I I I really hope that you will have continue to have a a very constructive attitude towards the work of this group and I I appreciate your flexibility. You have the floor, Sir. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement. So we have a a proposal from the Russian Federation to include two items under. After I after topic. Topic_3. Which are.  Arms and. Principles and principles to prevent.  Please need to. Place firing of weapons in outer space. Please. I will request the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation to correct me if I if I. If I got it wrong and the second one is the threat of use and and of four. Or use of force in in in outer space there is a proposal to include those those issues in our. Indicative timetable under.  The new. Topic which would be the new topic four and five. Could you please clarify whether this is correct? Thank you. I thank the distinguished. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for this clarification of of the proposal. And now I would like to see whether the the this proposal is acceptable for the delegations. As I said, we don't, we are not discussing a an official program of work, but informally we can accept the to include other items in the in our structure. I wonder whether there are comments. The distinguished Representative of Canada has the floor. I thank the distinguished Representative of Canada for his statement, and now I give the floor to the distinguished representative of the United States of the former ambassador. I thank the distinguished ambassador. Of the United States for his statement. OK so. Let us try to move on. So regarding the the proposal of the delegation of the Russian Federation, I I I suggest that they take up those items wherever they feel that they are. They're they're more relevant, as I said before, there is no need to. To to to adopt the unofficial program of work or agenda. That is precisely what we wanted to avoid by having this struct. Sure. So the structure, as I said and has been highlighted by so many delegations, is by nature a a proposal. It is, it is flexible. And so this, this two issues that the Russian Federation would like to to. I think that the the way the the the structure is presented, there are many places where they they can be included. I I don't think there is a need to continue to to discuss about the the the structure and the the indicative timetable the the IT should facilitate us to have this. Open discussion and and and to use our time. Our limited time in an efficient way. That is exactly what we're not doing now, so. We need to move. One now regarding the the the second issue I have heard that some delegations besides the one delegation says that there is no clarity regarding the issue of the participation of observers. I don't share that understanding because I as share have clarity on what the the, our our mandate is. And and did this actually what is clear to me is that my main task is to try to to to stick to the as strictly as possible to the mandate, and the mandate is clear. When it's I I. I read out in in the second part of paragraph_6 the IT it. Yes, a resolution_76231 that which established this group which. It clearly says that with the participation of intergovernmental organizations and other entities having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly, as well as organizations and bodies of the United Nations, and with the attendance of other international organization. In accordance with established practice, So what we are doing here is applying the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly and established practice it. I don't think that we it, it is up to us or or to me as a chair to change the Rules of Procedure of the. Assembly that goes much beyond our our very clear mandates, we are not allowed to do that. The rule of consensus can be used and can be misused in many ways, but in this case not to change the mandate that we have the very clear mandate that we have. So we can have a discussion and try to find consensus in our report regarding the substance and many other things that are not in the mandate we can discuss and we can, we may need consensus for, but not in, in in those issues that are very clearly. Established in the mandate and. Here we have the establish. Practice. The established practice is is, is I have. I have actually requested the Legal Office of the United Nations for examples of the established practice and and there are several examples I can mention the open and the working group on security and the use of information and. Communication technologies, the open-ended working group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international. Duty. the United Nations Conference to negotiate the legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons leading towards the total elimination. I I understand not. All of the. The Members here have participated in this one, but I did so I I I I I am a witness of the participation of observers. This conference, the open-ended working group advancing nuclear disarmament negotiations. The open-ended working group towards an armed straight treaty and the list is very long. I I I we don't have enough time to read all of the examples, but as I said, the mandate is very clear. We have to allow established practice and the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly to be applied in our group and it is not up to us, not up to the Chair, not up to the group, to to to discuss this issue. I repeat, if in the second session. I allowed in an exceptional way that the intervention of the an observer. To to to intervene in an informal setting. This was, as I said, exceptional, and I was very clear in in saying that they would not represent a precedent. So I really, really consider that this is not up to debate. We have a lot of things to debate actually, and we don't have much time. So I really request. The the The distinguished representative of the Russian Federation to not insist with with this point. I think that there there is, there is clarity. I do agree with one thing that the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation said in his first intervention that this issue is closed. He did say that it is closed. We should not discuss it further, and I agree with that. It is very close because it is in the mandate. And there is no doubt about it. In my understanding as a chair. Do we have more any other delegation that has requested the floor? Oh, I see the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. You. Have the floor. Of our work. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. Are there anymore requests? Yes, distinguished representative of Austria as the. Affected distinguished representative of Austria for his statement, and now I would like to give the floor to the English. Ambassador of the. United States, you have the floor ambassador. I thank the distinguished muscle of the United States for his statement, and now I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation of the floor, Sir. We would like to avoid a situation. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement, and now I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished representative of China. You have the floor, Sir. Thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement. And now I would like to offer the floor to the distinguished ambassador of the United Kingdom of the Frozen. I thank the distinguished ambassador of the United Kingdom and just a short reaction as a matter of fact, I would like to remind the delegations that we are not adopting or discarding anything. This is just. The proposal by the Chair to have an orderly discussion. We we we do not need to to agree on all of of the of of, of the the issues, the topics that I have have suggested. Of course there there will always be topics that are not completely covered or that that are not precisely the same and each delegation will have the possibility to speak freely. And and to add their views on on any of them and and and also we have any we have one specific topic which is any other issue so so there there there is plenty of room to. To elaborate on on on any topic, what we don't have plenty this time. So we need, we actually need to move on, but I have one request from before from the single shot presentative of Germany, you have the floor. I thank the distinguished representative of Germany for his statement. OK. So before we move into the substantial discussion because we have, we have lost already quite some time this morning and I hope it is not wasted time. Am regarding the topics that have been proposed by_1 delegation and supported by another delegation I think, but my my more than one delegation I I suggest to include those two topics under. Agenda item 6C, so we will, we will, we will also include the two topics that have been suggested by the Russian Federation. Any delegation that wishes to do so may may consider these topics. As I said again, this is not mandatory and the the agenda is the the the the indicative timetable is is is flexible enough to allow for. For this addition I I I do. What we would like I I would like to express my my concern regarding the the available time that we have. So I really would like to make a call to all delegations to to to be as constructive and cooperative as possible in order to start this discussion now on the. And in regarding the issue of of the participation of of observers, for me it is very clear I have no, no confusion. I I I I know the mandate very well and it is true that we are working on the basis of consensus. But this does not mean that we can change the mandate of our group. We cannot change the mandate of the resolution and we can also not change established practice or the rules of_0. For the General Assembly, that is not up to us. So there, there is no doubt whatsoever and I I propose to to take on this issue when when, if it, if it if it appears but I I want to be very transparent and clear with all delegations as I have been. So far and and what I have also made clear to delegations during the consultations that we have had previous to to this session. This is my understanding and and I have absolutely no doubt about my prerogative as a chair to make a ruling regarding the mandate that we have and which is under my responsibility. Now I have one request from the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. You have the floor, Sir. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. For his statement. Regarding the proposal to add_2 new topics, I understand that some delegations have represented some objections, but despite of this, I would ask for the flexibility of delegations to accept for the incorporation of these. These topics. Considering that the this is not an official program of work and there is every delegation will consider whether to engage in that discussion, whether to address it or not, it is really up to each delegation and and and considering. That we need to secure that every delegation feels comfortable and that all of the the issues and concerns are equally. Entered and as a sign of flexibility, I would like to request delegations to accept this. As I said before, we don't need to adopt anything so that there is one delegation that mentioned the possibility of discarding the indicative timetable. We don't need to discard something that has not been adopted. So both things are really redundant. We don't need to adopt any any decision formal decision. But I I do request delegations for flexibility in incorporating these two new topics into this indicative timetable. As it stands right now. Without prejudice of any any other topic that maybe may be erased. I have. Yeah, I. Thought somebody else. Has any delegation, any comment on this? Any objection to this proposal? The distinguished representative. Of the Russian Federation, I hope you. Don't object to. This proposal. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for this question. I cannot give you an exact time when we will discuss it because it will be on a time permitting and rolling basis, we we may reach that point. Earlier or later where I can I can I can tell you that in in the in the proposal we will include it for the afternoon of of, of tomorrow. Tuesday but but it may be earlier than that regarding the consideration of any topic, the way it is now reflected in. In in in this document, it is only speculative and we we, we, we, we I cannot give you the precise time when we are going to consider it since I don't have a notion of that position regarding any of the other topics either. So unfortunately I cannot give you a more precise answer. To your question, distinguished representative of Russian Federation. You have the floor, Sir. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. Regarding his question, we we we need to review the times that have been allocated because if we add more topics, obviously we will have less time for each one of them. But that said the the the time that it will be allocated is. Is also not going to be precise. It all depends of how the discussion evolves. Thank you very much. The the revised document will be circulated. Thank you very much. Unfortunately, we will not be able to start with the substantive discussion right now as we are running out of time. I see there is one more request from the Russian Federation. You have the floor, Sir. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement. Regarding the the so-called second issue, I have a very clear understanding of what the mandate is. The consensus is not without any limit, we have limitations we cannot on based on consensus decide. Things that are go against the Rules of Procedure and we cannot change the mandate of the group and we can also not change the established practice. When we discussed this in previous sessions. I have also made the point and I have shared my understanding. Particularly regarding the established practice, I have requested the Legal Office of the United Nations for examples and they have provided an exhaustive list of examples of established practice. I have read out a few of them. In in my previous intervention, I don't think there is a need to do it again. There is. Very clear understanding of what this established practice is. We are not going to. Change it in in in our group. So I as a chair, I understand that we have many very important substantial issues to discuss and to find consensus in order to fulfill our mandate and to find common understanding regarding possible recommendations on. Rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior. But not to discuss our mandate is not to discuss the Rules of Procedure. Our mandate is not to discuss what the established practice is. I as a chair, it is my responsibility to implement. In, as best as we can, the the mandate that we have. So I think that this is not an issue that is up to discussion right now. We we we we have to move as many delegations have set to the substance shall this. Question, but not continued discussing things that have been discussed previously. When the resolution_76231 was actually presented, this discussion took place in the General Assembly and the resolution was drafted in a way that leaves no room for interpretation or. Or or or to change the the Rules of Procedure or or the established practice so that is my understanding and I have been very transparent and very clear and I. Have taken note of the reservations of_1 delegation and the different understanding that that delegation has regarding the this mandate. But but I I will, I don't want to repeat myself, but I have no doubts whatsoever of what the mandate is in this. In in this regard, I see the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation, as requested, the floor you have. The floor, Sir. Council and the logins, regardless of the. I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement. Unfortunately, we we are running out of time because interpreters are leaving. But just to quickly react, I would like to say that I really appreciate the clarification of the position of the Russian Federation, and I fully agree that if there is any issue that delegations consider. That should be addressed and discussed. We should have that discussion. But that said, I don't think we need. Or that we are even entitled to decide on matters that are clearly established in the mandate of the resolution. And that is the case. In for the participation of observers. There is for me no doubt whatsoever, because many things can be interpreted, but the established practice in this regard cannot be interpreted as there are very clear examples of several meetings, processes, working groups and other fora. In the multilateral. Where these entities have participated, so that is something that is not up to us to. To to, to to to change we. We are not entitled to do that because it is clearly set out in the resolution. I take note of the of the clarification and of the position of the Russian Federation, but I I want to be very clear again and I don't want to repeat myself at this time but but it is, it is clear, absolutely clear to me. That we cannot decide to change the mandate of the resolution. I hope we can over over lunch, reflect and and understand and and accommodate this fact because it is a fact the the resolution has been drafted in a way that reflects the the the debates that took place. In the General Assembly. And and and I understand that some. Delegations are not completely satisfied with the result of the resolution, but that is the mandate that we have. We we cannot change it, we can, we can, we can, we can discuss a lot of things that are much more complex and important. But we cannot even start that if we don't accept that we have a mandate that that, that we need to move on. So I I would like to adjourn now. And uh. Thank the interpreters for the extra time we we are just beginning and you are you are already working overtime. So thank you very much for that and I hope that over lunch all delegations can can reflect and pause and meditate and and and think about the the, the, the, the the necessary. Constructive attitude that we all need if we want to actually engage in that substantial discussions that we we need. So please enjoy your lunch and I'll see you later. Meetings adjourned. \", 'Speaker_3': \"Thank you. Student general. First of all, we would like to support your constructive approach and the constructive message sent to all delegations in order to achieve consensus with respect. Not just to the very topic which has been presented as a issue for discussion during the third working group, but also as a whole to overcome discrepancies between. In delegations to achieve a single shared understanding which could enter the final outcome document of this group, I would like to assure you of the readiness of the Russian Federation to, in various ways, facilitate progress in discussions on exploring. Into using outer space and peaceful ends, and also for preventing an arms race in outer space. You can count on our support and cooperation, achieving a mutually acceptable set of results as a part of the OWG depend. Means not least on effective organization of its activities, and therefore we would like to discuss a couple of issues related specifically to the organization of the activities of this group during this third session specifically touch on the issue of articulating. The timeline for our work during this session, we believe that delegations must approve. Which the organization of a timetable in the most serious way, we would also like to touch on an issue which has arisen on a number of occasions since the very organizational session, and this is the issue of participation as an observer. Within the framework of official plenary sessions by non governmental entities. We consider that the approximate topic proposed by the chairman for this session requires further work to make our work more balanced and comprehensive. It is necessary for the interests and priorities of all UN Member States to be laid out and set forth in the list of topics presented for discussion by the third session of the OW. G in addition. The interconnection with the discussions that took place during the previous two sessions of the OG must also be sustained. Otherwise the discussion will be lopsided and is unlikely to help us towards achieving a single understanding around our final outcome. As the resolution's aforementioned is on the rules, principles, and norms for reducing space threats. To work during the second, third session must be directly linked to the discussions that took place during the second session on the EWG on space threats. Because the resolution. 76231 and even its title refers to developing possible principles and norms and so forth, and links it directly to space threats. Therefore, space threats and how we understand them. Are at the very. Basis of the work of this OWG. And it is working from that basic concept that we should consider the development of possible principles, norms and so forth. A methodological approach could be to conduct a discussion on hypothetical possible rules on the four different hypothetical groups of threats that we discussed last September, without identifying any specific threats and specific topical. Clusters. That is, we should focus on analyzing such possible nons principles and so forth on this space land vector space, space vector, land, Spector and land land. Moreover, this area of threats should not be reduced just to space systems, which was proposed in the indicative time table that was presented by the chairperson. All the more so because it is not completely clear what is meant by Earth, earth or space earth vector space systems. The terms we're using discusses that we're talking only about vectors related to the space. That is space space or. Space, the document presented is focusing on one specific type of threat. Above all that is earth space vector threat. Specific subtopics are highlighted, which budget questions with respect to the terminology. And the order of priorities and also a number of general questions too, which in the past were not discussed under this OWG. And the feasibility and correctness of the discussion, we get serious questions about the appropriate use of time on discussing such questions, which, in our opinion, are not problematic in the context of the topic which we're discussing. Our our tension is also drawn to the fact that Russian priorities are totally ignored, that is, the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space, the use of force or the. Threat of of. Force with respect to space objects or using them. Which is not acceptable in any comprehensive discussion. We do not understand at all why there is a specific topic which is given more time for discussion than the others. What were the criteria for allocating more time for discussion of certain issues? At the expense of others, this is unclear. There is another issue which also draws our most urgent attention. A large number of the questions and topics discussed are subject of discussion by the Space Committee. We would like to warn the members of. The WG away from focusing issues which are already handled by that body, ignoring as a part of the WG of the work of copper wars and attempts to duplicate efforts already conducted in Vienna. Is incorrect. It undermines the role of the Committee on Peace throughout the space. As regards developing any measures for transparency and confidence building that could be listed under the new norms and principles, we reaffirm our fundamental position. We believe that they must be focused on a total ban on the placement of weapons. In outer space, the use of force or the. Threat of the use of. Laws against space objects or using such objects that is complement but in no way substitute for the effective legally binding agreements on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. On the account of above, we do not consider this indicative timetable for the third session as something that we could use to guide and organise our work during this session. All the more so the structure presented in this document cannot be used as a foundation for building an appropriate corresponding section in the outcome document in order to achieve equal opportunities for discussion of various different proposals. And by Member States of the UN with respect to any possible norms, rules and principles in a balanced and comprehensive manner. We consider it would be optimal during this session to refrain from deploying this timetable as an indicative timetable. We propose not identifying specific topics for discussion, but to give delegations total freedom and the opportunity to raise any. Issues and. To discuss them interactively as a part of the discussion of the general topic, which was identified as the key topic for this or EWG session. Otherwise, if we are to dwell in the discussions under the indicative timetable, we could waste a huge amount of time. Before we managed to achieve any kind of consensus with respect to the issues that must be discussed during this session, the most important thing is how much time is needed to identify these topics. Esteemed Jefferson, with remembering the experience of our past work before we move on to discussing the substantive issues we would like to bring clarity once again with respect to the participation in the plenary session of groups that are. Non governmental and character, including those who have been given the status of observer by the corresponding NGO resolutions. And once again, we would like to discuss what this status of observer actually means. We note that the Russian position has not changed on this issue. Specifically, any non governmental structures, with the exception of the European Union. Can make a constructive contribution in. Only a written form as a part of the appropriate segment, organized particularly for that purpose by you as being chairperson. We confirm that is everything that you said in your introductory remarks with respect to the organization of the work and the understandings that were achieved by the delegations. During the organizational. Mission, as I already stated, there are two possible options for participation by non governmental entities as observers in the radiology that is as written, contributions or participation in informal special segments organised by you. For the participation in discussions by non governmental entities, we retain the right to reconsider this understanding. In the case of abuse by non governmental entities of this organization, or if discussions become. Destructive or undermining, undermining cooperation or agreement on the final outcome, such attempts to undermine our work cannot be acceptable by such bodies. We note the absence. Of consensus as of now on the possibility of statements by not of mental entities, with the exception of the European Union at official plenary meetings of the OWG, we consider this question now to be closed and we see no reason to reopen it and spend time. On it, therefore, esteemed chairperson, we propose moving on. On the basis of these understandings to discussion of substantive issues presented for discussion by the third session, thank you. Well, I think we. I now have the honor of. Extending the floor to the distinguished representative of Chile, you have the floor, Sir. Mr. Chairperson, how's my country? Speaking for the first time during. This third session. Of the EWG on reducing space threats, I would like to reiterate that we are fully confident. That we will make the progress necessary under your chairmanship, you can count on our support and full cooperation to achieve fruitful results. We would like to help you. Manage as you do so well with this meeting and the session, we thank you for being to give. A timetable which? We think will help us facilitate and organize our work as regards non governmental entities. Speaking as permanent observers, we are favourable to their presence. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss Steamship person. We listened very attentively. To the opinions and positions of delegations with respect to the issues that we raised, we would like to sum up in order to ensure a single shared. Understanding of how we are to organize our work. Subsequently in this session. And also with respect to program of work or timetable and the issues and topics which we plan to discuss during this third session and also. With respect to the possibility of statements being made by non governmental entities during the official plenary sessions of this working group. Our understanding is articulated around the opinions that have been stated and we can see that with respect to both issues, there is no consensus amongst the delegations. This is completely clear to us as regards the timetable. As we said, we are not casting any doubt whatsoever over the possibility of any delegation raising any issue during this session during the working group more broadly the. Problem with the. Is. Is that certain questions and topics are identified for discussion, very concrete issues and it there is a proposal here to specify the discussion on them and each topic. We have a specific time proposed and as far as I understand. If we now agree that this document can be used as guidance, then you esteemed chairperson will organise the work during the third session in line with the timetable laid out in this document. As we said in our previous statement, we do not consider this timetable to be balanced neither from the viewpoint of the specific issues and topics that have been set forth for discussion in the timetable, nor from the viewpoint of the allocation of the time available. Into the timetable. If delegations wish to start discussing the timetable of how we are to organize our work during the third session and identify specific topics that we are then to discuss, we are ready to do that work with. You but then. We will make a series of specific proposals to correct the document that was proposed by the respected chairperson. Into illia. As we already stated, we believe that the key priority is inclusion into this timetable of specific segments, that is time blocks for the discussion of issues of the prevention of place in. Of weapons in outer space. And also on a discussion of issues on the threat to the use of force or the use of force against space objects or using such objects. Given that specific topics are set forth that do not enjoy consensus support from the delegations, we consider it to be superfluous in the document proposed by the chairperson, we are extremely. Surprise at such issues, such as the prevention of patient weapons in outer space or the threat of use of or use of force against space activities. Objects do not figure at all in this document. These are issues that have been discussed for almost half a century by the international community. Do are they are in many ways the foundation of discussions of the prevention of an arms race in outer space, which is the key area in discussion of any work at the OEWG, because this working group was the 1st. To do so, if delegations are ready to discuss a substantive. Discussion on a possible timetable for the third session, we are ready to engage right now in such a discussion on the timetable. However, we do fear that that will take quite a bit of time and is unlikely to facilitate the organization in maximally. Effective and efficient manner. However, as we already stated, there may be another option and that is that we could simply set aside the document proposed by the chairperson. We are grateful to the chairperson and his team for compiling this document. Those delegations who wish to use this document as guidance. In terms of topics and in terms of the times they can use it, however. We would like to have a clear understanding that, for example, the Russian Federation delegation. Will not have to wait until the last day of the third session to raise the issues that we wish to raise. And moreover, that this timetable will not be used in any way as a guidance for the actual work during this session, what we are proposing here is to allow delegations to freely raise any issues starting from the first day of the third session. For the development of any possible norms, rules and principles on space activities and as part of our interactive discussion, discuss those questions without any linking to times or topics as listed in the timetable for those by the chairperson. As regards the second question. We do not in any way cast any doubt over the possibility of participation by non governmental structures as observers. At this working group. The problem is twofold. On one hand, the issue of the participation by such non governmental structures is not regulated whatsoever and by the rules and procedure of the General Assembly on the basis of which our work is organised. Moreover, on the other hand, there is an absence of a total. Care and complete understanding of what the status of fund observer actually means. What? Does it imply? If we are to talk about the references to standing practice at the General Assembly, that is references that were made by a number of Western delegations, we would like to. Say that the. Traditional practice is a. Very subjective and vague concept in different years at the General Assembly we have seen different. Practices, that is to say. Practice has changed, even in different bodies affiliated with the General Assembly. It is different and in different expert groups we have seen different practices where different issues are discussed. Moreover, there are specific explanatory documents produced by the nongovernmental bodies. Themselves with respect to the development of the resolutions themselves. That is, the generation, the resolutions of the General Assembly on the status of such entities. There are such explanatory notes on the status. Of the status of the permit observer of the ICRC in the 1990s. And this was. Identified very clearly that that status of observer. Participation in the form of written contributions to the work of the General Assembly. The history around statements at official plenary sessions is a recent history. It is only in recent years. And if we take this working group, we can see that there may have been such a practice, but this is not the case of all working groups. We must take this into account. Therefore, we believe that this issue is completely open for discussion with respect to the relevant. Parts of General Assembly resolution_76. 231. We would like to remind the respected delegations that that resolution is a recommendation in terms of its character. It was not adopted as a consensus either, a number of delegations spoke out against it and disputed the. Concepts set forth in resolution_76231 and so specific issues of the organization of the work of our group were. Submitted at the organizational session. Moreover, we have a clear understanding that this working group acts on the basis of consensus as of today. That consensus is absent in terms of the issue of whether non governmental entities. Can speak during official plenary sessions. We consider that this should be the facts on the basis of which we should work. We do not believe that the delegations have taken a shared consensus based decision now, which would allow non governmental. Entities to make statements during official plenary session. Moreover, I would like to under score that our delegation does not doubt or cast any doubt over the status of the permanent of service, which allows them to continue to make written contributions to the work of the group and also to speak in informal segments which may be organised. By the chairperson. This is our understanding and we would like to once again under score that there is no consensus on this issue. Therefore no authorities. To make statements on the part of the chairperson or search number, mental organizing entities exist at the current time. Thank you. Those are still all those bullet that comes in and the new idea. Thank you very much, chair person. I can agree with you with respect to the following, we do need clarity. A precise understanding. Of issues of. How this group's work is to be organised otherwise without that. Extremely difficult to continue the discussion and this could lead to serious problems at subsequent stages. With respect to the timetable, do we understand correctly that in this room? There is one single opinion. That you chairperson are allocating specific time slots for the discussion of those two issues that were identified by our delegation. We heard a number of objections. From_2 delegations. All of those delegations, ready to demonstrate flexibility that is not yet clear to us. We would simply like to respond to those arguments that. Listed by those delegations as follows, if we were. To proceed logically. Optimizing this list, many of the topics. In this list could also be included in other topics, for example two and three, which we believe to be comprehensive. In that case. We don't really need topic_3, which is present in this list of topics. We don't really need topic four in the timetable. It's not completely clear to us what we intend to discuss under that topic.  And the same. Goes for other topics, including general topics. Therefore, we would like to understand the following. Is there a single opinion and agreement that those two topics that we proposed will be discussed separately at a specific time, for example, tomorrow under, for example, topics_4:00 and_5:00? As a part of this session. Of the working group. As yet, we do not have such an understanding. We have heard objections and we perceive that to be the same as a lack of consensus. If there is no consensus, we are ready to discuss this timetable as a whole. As I already said, it could be further optimised or as we proposed. At the beginning, we could simply decline using this timetable, set it aside and discuss_5 BC of Resolution_76/231. And discarding the timetable is an option. Then any delegation could raise any issue at any time as a part of the third session, regardless of what specific issues are raised by other delegations. It's up to us to decide. That we do need to decide. How are we going to organise the work during this session? How we're going to discuss issues which issues we're going to discuss, or perhaps we can simply be given complete freedom to discuss any issues at any time over these five days. As regards the issue of non governmental structures. As we already mentioned. The key issue. Here is the understanding of the concept of established practice. Our delegation, in proposing what we proposed at this working group, does not intend to overhaul the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly. The GAO Rules of Procedure are what they are. They remain unchanged. The question is about the fact that there's a very general. Discussion of the role of. Permanent observers. It's not clear what established practices are. There's just a mention of the permanent observers, so the Rules of Procedure that we have. With now. Indicate rather that we should not discuss this issue because there is not clarity in the Rules of Procedure of what participation means for non governmental entities, as observers in plenary sessions. There is no clear. Formula in the text there is no clear language either. With respect to what established practice is considered to be our delegation, see is established practice. To be one thing. But we have seen that other delegations see established practice. To be different. Moreover, there's a dichotomy between the plenary sessions of the General Assembly of the year end and the plenary sessions of the bodies and other associated bodies. There are different practices, and over the years, that practice has also changed. This does not mean that the practice. Be used in one working group can considered to be practice that is established for other working groups. Now is there. Clarity on this issue if there was clarity, we wouldn't be spending so much time during the organizational session or subsequent sessions of this working group on discussing this issue. However, the fact that. We're continuing to discuss this issue to us is a very clear signal, meaning that. This issue has not been resolved or regulated and there is no consensus amongst the delegations. This is a clear fact now that must be recorded identified. We must accept this reality. Because, as was stated quite. Mandate of the group in the text of resolution_76231. The principle of consensus is the basis of the work of this working group, and so with respect to any issues on the work of this on working group, we need to have consensus first. I would like to note that in the mandate of the group, there is only a reference to certain so-called established practice which. Is a concept that is not defined in that same text. Therefore, esteemed chairperson, we agree with you that this issue now is closed. There's a single understanding across the working group that, with respect to the issue of the participation in the plenary sessions of not mental entities. There is no consensus on that. That is a shared. Understanding and so they cannot be authorised to speak and we cannot authorise you, chairperson, to authorise no governmental entities to speak. This does not, however, change in. Any way?  The rules of. Procedure of the General Assembly and does not change in any way. The established practice in the. Sessions of the General Assembly. However, it may be understood by certain delegations. This strictly refers to the work of this working group and the activities of associated bodies of the General Assembly. This is how the delegation, the Russian Federation, understand this situation. This is the national position of of. Country it is of fundamental character and it must be taken into account by all participants of this working group and by you, esteemed chairperson. Therefore, once again we propose that we stop going round in circles in this working group that we note. The absence of consensus on this issue and move on to discussion of the substantive issues that are laid out for discussion at this third session of the O EWG. Our delegation sees no other way forward we. Are not ready. To yield from this position. This is the position which we have broadcast on a number of occasions. Of this working group and we would like to ask now that our position is taken into account and for the OWG to continue to work in line with the situation that is currently. Existent in line with the positions of all delegations, including the Russian Federation. Thank you. Thank you, chair person, we would like to respond to a number of comments that were made by other delegations on the issues that we presented for discussion. On the timetable. We can see that one delegation is attempting to dispute the proposals that we made with respect to this indicative timetable for the discussion organization of discussion time in this connection. We can see that we are getting deeper and deeper into discussion of this timetable and the issues that are laid out as topics in the document. Given the logic that has been voiced. The one delegation. Is making proposals for a document which United States of America may consider does not enjoy support from other delegations. Same logic to be followed with respect to all of this document and all of the organization of our work. For example, we don't see that a number of issues that have been set forth in that document. On the one hand, fully correspond to the mandate of the group. For example information exchange. How does this topic relate to the mandate of our group? The topics of sending notifications we don't quite understand how that is related to our mandate, and notably 6C, where we speak of possible norms, rules and principles. Moreover, we consider that in this case we could. Then, in fact, restrict ourselves to just two topics. For example 2A and 2B. Perhaps we could leave topic one. If delegations are interested and leave. The last two topics. Which discuss other aspects and the second part of 6C on the legal legally binding instruments then probably that would fall in line with 6C of the group's mandate. But all the issues of dual use. Or protection objects or information exchange consultations. In our opinion, these topics are not directly linked to 6C and therefore it's hardly worth allocating dedicated discussion time to them, so we can apply one logic or we can apply another logic either or. We take all of the topics which delegations wish to discuss. And we discuss them or we can develop a consensus with respect to the topics which all delegations wish to discuss and consider necessary for discussion. We can hardly imagine any other. Except from the current situation we need. To choose one of these two different logical approaches and follow that logic as we organise the work of this session. As regards the second question. I will repeat in response to what was stated by the Austrian delegation. We consider it to be very challenging to move on to the discussion of substantive issues before we have completed discussion of the Organization of work of the session. You can't start the work of a session without having a shared understanding of how that work will be organised. Including the possibility of statements by non governmental entities. Where we start the substantive discussions and suddenly some non governmental entity starts to speak. At the plenary session. No, we need to be clear. We need to register the decision on the proposals on statements by non governmental entities during the plenary session, as we already said, we have to register whether we have a consensus on this or not. So far we see no such consensus. To start the substantive discussion without reaching agreement on basic questions is impossible because it would expose us to undermining the work. If there were collisions which the Austrian delegation himself mentioned. We would like to avoid that situation as we are totally not interested in undermining the work of the OWHE and we hope that all delegations, including the Austrian delegation, are not interested in undermining the work of the group also and they are submitting contradictory proposals in our opinion. Thank you. Now consolidated subviews questions. \", 'Speaker_4': \"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you to you and the team from the secretariat for. All the work. That you have put in to prepare for this session, as you said at the beginning, we are reaching A crucial stage in our work where we have to start making recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles and as such. That we're looking forward very much to the discussions this week, building on what has been, as you said, a very constructive atmosphere so far in. Work. My delegation has absolutely no difficulty with the indicative timetable you have proposed. As you say, it is an indicative timetable. It is simply a proposal to structure our work. We have to structure it somehow and we think this is as good as as as any way of doing that. We will also note that. See within the_10 topics you have proposed, ample scope for any delegation to raise anything it deems relevant to agenda item 6C. The delegates to the Russian Federation appeal to the title of the resolution on reducing space threats and and of course, that's absolutely appropriate. I would also note, of course, that agenda item 6C and the reference to space systems also comes from the resolution. So we we we need to decide whether we're sticking to the text of the resolution or not. But my my delegation certainly has has no difficulty with the timetable you have proposed. On the other question just raised that of the participation by observer delegations, we did have a discussion about this last meeting. I don't think partly what was just said that we. Did actually reach a conclusion on that we reached a a an accommodation that would allow us to continue our work without further disruption. But if this question is going to come up again then of course we need to adhere to the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, but also the established practice of the General Assembly. Again, as is very clearly. Set out in the resolution resolutions of the General Assembly. Give certain organisations the right to participate in the work of the General Assembly. As observers permit. Right. The established practice of the General Assembly as set out, for example in the delegates handbook, gives those organisations the recognises that that those organisations participate by speaking in formal sessions of the of the GA. This body is a subsidiary body of the GA. We are bound by the GA's rules. Procedure and by its established practice, and we would certainly defend the right of those permanent observer organisations to speak in the formal work of the session, as they do in the General Assembly and, as they have done in other open-ended working groups, in the disarmament sphere. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We seem to have spent an awful lot of time this morning discussing a document which is not actually up for adoption or discussion, and which is simply meant to be a a planning tool to help us all structure what is quite a complicated discussion, if any delegation wanted to undermine. The work of this group that would be a. Very effective way of doing it. It I would suggest simply that if you that we proceed with our substantive work. If the chair wants to suggest to delegates that they concentrate their statements on a particular issue, that is your prerogative as chair, it is every delegation's prerogative as a delegation to raise any issue it likes to be guided by that suggestion or not. So I would suggest that we proceed on that basis and if you would like to. Offer us some guidance for our consideration. Then we are free to take that or not, but we can't carry on going round in circles as one delegation seems to be determined to make us do on the question of the rights of delegations to speak. I can do no better than to reiterate what my Austrian colleague just said. We will deal with the question when it arises, and if you have to make. A rule and Mr. Chair. \", 'Speaker_5': \"We we would. But yeah. Let me just start out by saying that the Canadian delegation has the utmost faith in your leadership and guidance. You've done an excellent job over the first two sessions of the OWG, including preparing indicative timetables for both of those sessions, which have resulted in very productive work and Canada. Has faced that the timetable, the indicative timetable that you've prepared for this session would equally result in. Productive outcomes should we apply it flexibly with respect to the proposal to change or add topics? One point of clarification would be whether we would be substituting these two new topics in or adding them to the existing list of topics which would bring us to_12 topics. Over the five days, which seems like it. Would be a bit much. The second thing I would note is one that you've already noted in many delegations themselves noted that this is a flexible indicative timetable. States are free to discuss the issues they want under these topics and any issues they want, and I'm certain they will do so when they want to. That won't. Be a problem. But should there be any questions about adding new or arranged topics, I would simply note. Topics_2 and three could easily be used to accommodate questions or or statements regarding norms for the prevention of placements of weapons in outer space. I don't think there's really any need to alter them, but if they needed to be altered in some way, that's where this discussion could take place. It would easily fit under there. Secondly, with respect to. Prevention of use of force against weapons. I think the topic_4 probably covers that already. As written. I mean if we need to amend it in any way, we could simply. Amended to say norms, rules and principles relating to outer space, objects or activities that should enjoy protection. From the use of force or something to that matter, but it seems like that topic already contemplates the suggestion. So from our point of view, this indicative timetable is fine. It's flexible states can raise what they want the the two particular issues that were raised by the delegation of the Russian Federation can easily be accommodated in topics_2-3 and four without upsetting the timetable. Or adding additional new topics could cause us to. Run through our. Work. I think that would be an easy way of handling this with respect to the issue of parts. Patient, I feel it's a mischaracterization to say there's no consensus on participation. It's actually the reverse. We have established rules of practice about the participation of observers. We have resolution_76 slash_231, which once again explains what participation is. I think it's more accurate to say there is no consensus to change the established. And since there is no consensus to change the established practice, we should proceed as is and get to the. Substantive part of our work. Without spending any more time on this particular issue because this is not a form where we can change the established rules of General Assembly resolution practices. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \", 'Speaker_6': \"Along the lines. Of of what was just stated by the by. We are very comfortable with the indicative timetable that you have put. Note that this does not prevent any delegation from raising relevant issues at any time with respect to the participation of the intergovernmental. Organizations and other entities. Our view is that they have a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly. As well as organizations and bodies of the United Nations, and with the attendance of other international organizations, commercial actors and civil society representatives, in accordance with established practice. The IRS, ICRC has a standing invitation to participate in the GO. As an observer, they were granted this status and General Assembly resolution_49 slash_2 adopted in_1994. Accordingly, there should be no question regarding their participation in this body, whether in formal or informal session, as their right to participate was clearly set forth in the in the original resolution. Moreover, some of these organizations plainly have expertise relevant to this body's work, and any attempts to exclude them. And participating in our work are cynical, groundless, and contrary to established practice. Thank you, chair. Thank you, chair. I would like to support the Canadian statement and I would note. On the latter point, and there's plenty. Of room to take up. Issues that the Russian Federation would like to take up. Unfortunately, we are now about two hours short of taking up some of those issues because we've wasted so much time on procedural issues and this is a a good example of trying to use the consensus. Principle to to interfere with regular procedures that allow us to do our work instead of getting down to the substance of things we all understand that any final decisions, consensus decisions on substance do need to be taken by consensus. But that's not the same thing as as as having discussions and then on the on the latter point. Again, if this is a a UN General Assembly practice, then if if Russia wishes to do so, it it should take that that proposal to the UN General Assembly to get a a ruling on what constitutes an acceptable intergovernmental organization. Thank you. Chair on the organizational point just raised by our Austrian colleague, I would suggest that there must be a list of of the organizations that are participated in any number of meetings and that that would could be used as a way to establish just what established practice consists of. So that's something that was accepted. In the past, should probably continue to be accepted now on the first point, I think we would object to the idea of of setting aside separate separate time slots for the proposals raised by_1 delegation. On simply on the behalf of one single delegation, I would suggest there might be a way then to to slightly change the wording of some of the existing headings in a way that allows the the the the subjects that that the Russian Federation wishes to raise to be included in those topics. But I don't think that it is appropriate for one delegation to come to this meeting and demand that the the timetable will be changed completely in order to accommodate its own parochial interest. Thank you. \", 'Speaker_7': \"The United Kingdom. Out we would. Thank you, Mr. Chair, also from our side as we speak for. The first time. We want to assure you of our full support for. The conduct of this meeting and the constructive discussions. On the two. Procedural items that have been brought up now this morning, first on the participation of non governmental actors in particular. The ICRC we are of a similar position as others that have spoken before us. There has not only been a standing invitation through the resolution itself, that was very clear that they could participate as observers in the work of the of the General Assembly. In accordance with established practice, our research has shown this this practice has been established several times in different working groups in. The field of. Disarmament and non proliferation. So there's not much question on on that regard. In addition, there's many have pointed out there is also the. Resolution of_19. 90 Who grants the ICRC a very special. Status and there is a Third Point that is. Quite important here. That we are. Working here as the UK has pointed out. Under the rules of the Gen. Assembly it is not up to us to change those rules. Therefore there is also no consensus rule on lack of consensus that could affect those rules. So we can continue under those rules as they are at the moment, and this is the way this meeting should be conducted. The second point about the indicative timetable. From our point of view, this also follows the logic of our previous meetings, the 1st and the second session that we had followed the the logic and the structure of the resolution under its Article_5. On the ABCD, we are currently under the Point C. If we follow this logic and therefore it's quite clear that we should work under the title that you have given you had given the the today's meetings or that the indicative timetable more or less has given this meeting on the topics themselves. We think it's a very good choice we can fully support the different topics that are here, but it's also, as the UK has done, quite important to point out that this is only an indicative time. People, there's a lot of flexibility, a lot of scope. What we can talk about under the different topics that are here also, we ourselves might need to be flexible and maybe speak on a later stage this week on earlier topics. So we don't see this as something that binds us or that is complicated or pose any problems so. Therefore, full support also from our side on all the topics given, and we will use them flexibly, and there's a constructive impact from from your side on how. To proceed, I thank you. As we see it, the scope is. It will be. Do we also need to proceed? We need to get. To the substantive part of our work. We don't see a need to register that there is no consensus as we've explained previously, this is not something that actually matters. We should proceed now. And when it comes to the point of time, when we have the situation where an observer request to speak, I think you will have to make a decision and then in the case of objections, through a point of order or anything like that, the ruling on that matter and I think this should be the proper way to conduct the meeting. This point on. And on the 2nd letter that we discussed indicative timetable. We have no particular problem with changing it and maybe this should also be something under your capacity that you could propose a new indicative timetable as you did with the first one. We just note that that the topic. Of prevention of an arms race in outer space. Is already included under agenda item 6C at the title as a whole, so it is an overarching theme that probably could be wrapped up under all the topics that you have chosen here at the same time, we have no objection with including such a topic as a particular item somewhere in the text. But we think that this should be. Also, under your discretion, I thank you. \", 'Speaker_8': 'Thank you, chair. This is my first time to speak at this working group. Please allow me on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to express support to your work. There will be other delegations Chinese ready. To participate in the debates in a constructive manner. And we promote progress in our debates. On the issues raised by the Russian colleague. Especially can participate in our work. I remember that during the second session we discussed this issue. I carefully listened to the statement by the Russian delegate a moment ago. I understand that he refers to all angels rather than any single one. For example, the ICC. Therefore, on the issue of Angel participation in the meeting. The states at the moment lack consensus. I hope that. The chairman will consult fully with the relevant states. To find an appropriate solution. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just now I listened carefully to the statements. By all parties. On the idea of. On the inductive timetable, the easy raised by the Russian colleague, I wish to make some comments. Hand the chair and the Secretarian put forward a timetable. I wish to extend thanks for their efforts. Do you chairman connected consultations and issued the the updated timetable on the other hand? The chairman, you yourself stated just now. That this is not a formal program of work. It is known indicative document. All states can put forward their views on it. Different states hold different views on what topics we should discuss. This is quite normal. We should hold an open and impressive approach. Just need the Russian colleagues raised_2 new topics. Is the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space. The placement of weapons in outer space. The 2nd is on the prevention of abuse or threat of use of force in outer space. These two issues are very important to us. Therefore, I propose that we give a consideration to these proposals from the Russian delegate. Thank you. ', 'Speaker_9': \"Thank you very much. Chair for all your work preparing us for this session. My delegation fully supports your proposed approach. I'll take the floor to add my voice to comments made by the UK, the US and France regarding formal participation in this meeting by observer delegations under Resolution_76/23. One which created this open-ended working group is clear. It invited participation of intergovernmental organizations and other entities, having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly, of which the ICRC is_1, as well as organisations and bodies of the UN, in accordance with established practice. That established practice and codification of such practice clearly demonstrates that entities enjoying observer status participate in the UN General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies as observers by attending and making statements in formal plenary meeting. Things we call on this open-ended working group to follow established practice and for observer entities such as the ICRC to be allowed to make oral interventions in formal plenary sessions of this meeting. Thank you, chair. And there and. \", 'Speaker_10': \"Thank you, chair, for giving me the floor. The Netherlands would like to echo comments just made by the delegations of the United States, the UK, France and Australia on the participation of intergovernmental organizations and other entities having received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly, we are convinced that the established practice. Really allows participation by entities enjoying observer status, such as the ICRC, and to make all interferences in all meetings of of the open-ended working group in addition to written contribute. As regards this week's indicative timetable, we fully support the approach you have conveyed in advance to this group and in which you have just for expanded. We are also fully convinced that with this approach, delegations will have ample opportunity to bring issues to the floor that are irrelevant for the work of this group. Thank you. Very much. \", 'Speaker_11': \"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and we haven't started our our substantive discussions yet, but let me wish you the best of luck and assure you of my delegations full support with regard to the timetable that you circulated. My delegation can fully support the indicative structure that you set out. It should allow any delegation to raise. Any issue that it sees is relevant to the work of the OWG, so therefore we're very happy to proceed in this. Way with regard to the participation of observers at my delegation, that's its voice to those that have already spoken and we were very active and engaged in the discussions on this issue, of course as well at the last session of the. OWG. Came as the distinguished representative of the United Kingdom. Mentioned came to an accommodation at your request to allow our work to continue on that occasion. However, we must, as has been stated by others, follow the. Rules of Procedure. We have no mandate and no authority in this group to overturn the Rules of Procedure of the GA, and there's certainly no consensus to suddenly change the manner in which we work, the resolution establishing the OWG invited the participation of intergovernmental organizations and other entities, having received a standing invitation to participate. As observers in the work of the General Assembly, in accordance with established practice. Established practice and the codification of such practice clearly demonstrates that intergovernmental organisations and other entities enjoying observer status participate in. The work of the. GA and its subsidiary bodies of observers by attending and making statements in the formal plenary meetings and by submitting written contributions. Among others, without the right to vote, such participation should follow established practice. Including by allowing. Any observers to make oral interventions in all meetings of the OWG. I think your opening statement. At the beginning of this session. Very clearly set out in a reasonable way how we can proceed in line with the Rules of Procedure of the GA and in line with the resolution establishing the RWG itself. And you have our full support in carrying out the function as you set out at the beginning of this. Session. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \", 'Speaker_12': \"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It's a pleasure to be here at the at the outset. My delegation would like to thank you for your efforts in preparing for this session and to assure you of our full support that extends of course, to the injective timetable that you have presented to us. We believe that this is a good way to organize our work and we see it as establishing no hierarchy between the issues that are under our agenda is just immunity of a way to focus our discussions and but at the same time, nothing prevents any delegation. Establishing cross linkages between different issues in their interventions and and thus contributing to richer debate as regards the issue of participation of NGO's, we are also of the view that this is very clearly established in our mandate and also. Follows established practice of the UNGA and its subsidiary bodies, but also of our previous sessions. This has been the case in the 1st and the sessions second session. So we see no need to revisit those issues at this point. We believe that the NGOs and in particular the ICRC have made very relevant contributions to our work and any curtailing of this participation will weaken our substantive discussions. Without this, participation does not mean. Any prejudice to the Utah governmental nature of this group, and we very much look forward to beginning our substantive discussions. Thank you very much, chair. Your address. As a part. \", 'Speaker_13': \"Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation shares the observations made by many delegations already this morning. Quite frankly, we're not. We do not quite understand why we are discussing the issue of participation of intergovernmental organisations of entities as the text of the resolution. 76/231 seems quite clear to us. Leaves no doubt whatsoever to the participation attending and making statements of those. According to established practice, which is also indicative timetable, as the name implies, it indicates it does not prescribe prescribe, so it gives us the necessary flexibility to discuss all the issues on the table. I thank you, Mr. Chair. \", 'Speaker_14': \"Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, let me thank you for your excellent work in steering the work of this open-ended working group. And I can assure you of the continued cooperation and support of my delegation. I'll be very. Brief as expressed by many others, not least the Italian ambassador right before me. Sweden supports the indicative timetable that you have proposed, which allows for the flexibility and offers ample time for delegations to address all issues of importance and secondly, I also wish to support the participation of civil society organizations and international participate organizations. To take part as observers in our work in line with the established practices of the United Nations General Assembly, it's been evident that civil society organizations and international organizations have contributed greatly to the work of this open-ended working group, and they should be able to continue to do so. Thank you. Senior President, Primera intervention. Thank you, chair. Let me at the outset assure you that you can count on the support of my delegation. We have full confidence in how US chairs during the work of this group. We fully support your proposed indicative timetable, which has received a lot of support this morning, which we find is in line with the the resolution. In previous builds on the previous work done in this group in the 1st_2:00. Sessions, we see ample opportunity throughout the program to raise all issues relevant to the purpose of this group. I would also like to add the voice of my delegation to that of several other delegations who have spoken on the issue of participation of observers. It is in line with the practice of the UN General Assembly that permanent observers can participate as observers by attending and attending and making statements in formal plenary meetings and by submitting. Written contributions. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Which the majority. \", 'Speaker_15': 'Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for your efforts to prepare and present the session. We also support your proposal for the indicative timetable, which serves as good guidance concerning the participation of observers as have already mentioned many other delegations, we are in favor of following the established practice. And the the mandate and so hopefully allow parties. You can count on our constructive participation as well. ', 'Speaker_16': \"Thank you very much, chair. And then thank you for the hard work that is going to. Preparing this meeting, we find that the indicative timetable provides good guidance for our work this week, and as you mentioned, it is of course only indicative and. Sufficiently brought to cover or allow for any discussion or points of view that the Member States should wish to have or raise under agenda. Item 6C this week. On the issue of participation, I don't think there's any point in labelling that much more like for the interventions before this one, but we would just like to add our voice. To the many previous. Speakers on the issue of non governmental participants, the resolution that establishes this OWG is very clear on the issue and to governmental organizations and other entities having received a standing invitation to participate as observers. Intend to participate in our meetings and according to the clear intention and established practice in the GA. This includes the right to speak informal meetings. Yeah, I will. Just leave it at that. Thank you. Now I would. Clearly in the very. We would like that. \", 'Speaker_17': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. My delegation wishes you the best as we undertake our work, hopefully without too much delay. This week, my delegation wishes to speak on the point of participation that has been raised by several delegations now on participation by non governmental entities, in particular International Committee of the Red Cross. My delegation is especially concerned about creating a new precedent that a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly to depart from the rule set down for it. That would be a very dangerous precedent to create and has, and, as has already been raised by Ireland, Australia and other distinguished colleagues, far beyond our brief. To determine for ourselves. As has already been widely noted, our established practice provides for the participation of the ICC as a permanent observer of the UN General Assembly, and that is a practice that we wish to maintain. Today we look forward to the contributions of these delegations, enriching our discussions. This week I thank you. At the end of it. Be it. Thank you. ', 'Speaker_18': \"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you to the Chair for excellent preparation also of this third working group of the EWG. And we are fully comfortable with the indicative timetable. That leaves enough flexibility to raise all questions that should be raised at our session. And we would also align fully ourselves with all these statements. And support and in favor of participation of international organizations and at this meeting and we are very much looking forward to a constructive discussion on the substance of our matter. Thank you. On the one. I don't want to abuse the time of all of us and to continue this discussion. But for us it would be also very difficult to to accept the logic of what I see. One single delegation or_1 1/2 delegations here. And to introduce new agenda items or to start a lengthy discussion on new. Gender items. And when I looked at the mandate of the OWG and I don't see any reason why to include these specific items. And I would like to remind the words of the Russian delegations in its initial initial intervention. When they said that we should be also guided by which we have discussed previously during the previous session session one and session two, especially on threats, but also on other items. And I think the chair has very wisely chosen a range of topics from these previous. Discussions and. They are up to discussion and also in the third important session of the W. And on the other hand, the items proposed by the Russian Federation, they have a long history. They assert different strands and they are extensively discussed in other fora and have been discussed in Ruby and, and it's not enough to just to put the. Norms, rules, and principles on before and then take up the same items here. So we would have big difficulties to accept this and and I could understand even the Russian Federation, if there were no appropriate item for raising these. But from my understanding, topic_8 already makes reference to to part of the questions raised here and would be the perfect place. Understanding the flexibility we all accept. For this session to to discuss these topics. Thank you. \", 'Speaker_19': \"Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, sorry for being late. Actually we, we. Waiting for the badge. Therefore, we we did last part of this meeting so far since I am the last speaker on this issue and I waited until to see what is happening. Actually we have two point to make one. First and foremost is regarding the timetable, of course, so many delegation have supported the timetable. They are right that it could give some flexibility, but so far as the timetable is concerned and its relation. With the summary that you have prepared as well as the possible element on the items of the recommendations concerned, we do not see that the timetable is exactly the one that could bring us to the issue that. Ultimately, as everybody is suggesting that take us to the discussion of legal binding document, because in our view, as we have addressed that in our working paper in in the last meeting as well as the statement that we have made. It seems to us that the possible elements on the nerves and possible rules has been taken for granted so far as this issue is concerned, and the mandate and the name of this open-ended working group, although it has come. From the title of the resolution, we should so far should remind that the resolution has not been adopted unanimously so far. You are, I think, quite aware of this issue. That so many countries have adopted have weighted negatively and some. That's necessarily our new means that this concept of responsible behavior that take us to norms and rules means that for consideration of the root of their country that they are yet contending on the approach in our understanding there are two approaches. Of course, those who have given positive votes are favoring of soft law as. I think very eloquently the Chinese. People has addressed that issue. But this issue of norms and possible norms should not be taken for granted that we should work on that basis. Fortunately or unfortunately, the two paper that you have prepared has been prepared on the assumptions that this issue of norms, possible loans and so on. Being adopted so far as the issue is concerned, even seems possible norms. Therefore, it might be no possible norms to follow ultimately. Therefore, I should remind that, for my delegation and some other delegation, this approach of possible means is not the way that ultimately end us to the to the result, so far as these two contending approach are yet in the discussion of this open. In that working group. And unfortunately, since the city has not been able and the issue of the Paris as a legal binding document has not been negotiated so far in the in the city, we don't think that this issue of norms and possible norms could be substituted to legal binding. Document. I don't want to prolong my. My intervention here, but just I wanted to remind to the distinguished that in order to keep the balance between the two approaches, I I think that the approach of those that are not favoring the possible loans should be also taken into account by the distinguished share. And any paper that is prepared by the church should keep. The balance so. And well, as far as we have examined those two, we see that the of course the legal binding document has been reflected in the Chair. But this approach that I am saying, the approach of those that are favoring the legal binding documents and do not see the norms and possible norms as a substitute. Illegal binding document should be also taken in any paper that you prepare. What I see is that is very tall. Reflection of the second approach, and I humbly request you, Mr. Chair, that any paper that you prepare, you consider that these two approaches are yet should be discussed and the approach of those who have voted positively. Of course, the large number have given voted positively. But it should not be taken for granted, because here we are working on the basis of consensus and until and unless the the controversy between the two two approaches should not be solved, it is impossible to decide on this issue. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Since this is the first time for my delegation to take the floor, allow me to thank you again for the excellent work that you have been doing in stealing the work of this group. I would like to make three points. First, the Philippines supports the timetable that you have prepared and commence you for your proactive. Second, the Philippines supports the participation in an inclusive manner. For of all non governmental organizations, in accordance with the practice and rules and procedure of relevant United Nations body. And 3rd we would like to agree with the previous speaker on the need for this group to consider all points of view with a view to arriving at a consensus set of recommendations for the General Assembly. However, my delegation takes exception to the characterization that there is a dichotomy between those supporting soft law or norms or formulation and clarification of norms of responsible behavior and those who are supporting a legally binding instrument, and that this dichotomy should also be I should also guide. The consideration of of of your work as chair in terms of drafting relevant documents that could serve as a basis of our work. The Philippines obviously supported the rest. Solution that created the OWG and we have engaged constructively in the consultations leading to the adoption of the resolution and in our in our constructive participation in those consultations. We have consistently championed the need for our. Work to end with the aspiration that we need legally binding. Instrument related to outer space security, including on the prevention of an arms race and outer space, and we see that there is no inconsistency between soft laws or or the the clarification of norms of responsible behavior and this aspiration, and this is reflected in our positions. This is reflected in our written. Admissions and our statements as well as in the value statements. Of ASEAN Member states at the first committee and also in the OWG, so we would just like to register that view that we see no dichotomy between self law and norms of responsible behavior and support for legally binding instrument. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \", 'Speaker_20': 'That should be. With prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space. The topic. Rules and principles relating to the prevention of the use of force. The threat of force. With regard to space object objects. Or with its use. So glad so you can open your mind is. For supervision. ', 'Speaker_21': \"Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Up until now, my delegation has been a little reluctant to take the floor just because I feel that this conversation, while perhaps important, has taken us away from the substantive discussion and the work that we are here to discuss for more. Been halfway through the first session and we haven't yet touched the main point of the agenda, as many delegations have already pointed out. You know the. The practice of these observers taking the floor in the formal sessions is established practice under the UN General Assembly rule. There we do not believe that there is a need for consensus on the issue of observer. Participation is standard practice and we are not in a position to act contrary to rules that have been set by the body under which this working group has been created. Mr. Chair, the last session of the OWG you asked for our indulgence in order to move ahead with the work of the group. Of us granted, as we, as I've pointed out, more than halfway through this morning's session, I think it is fair to ask for the indulgence of the Russian Federation to compromise on this particular point to allow us to continue this substantive work of this group. On the issue of. The timetable I can. Only echo out the previous many of my previous colleagues have already said the indicative program as you have laid out, does allow for substantive input on any issue that the delegates would wish to raise, and so I do not feel the need to. Alter the indicative program as you have laid out, and I'm certain that those delegations that wish to raise particular issues will do so at whichever point they wish or feel would be appropriate. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \"}\n"

opinion, these topics are not directly linked to 6C and therefore it's hardly worth allocating dedicated discussion time to them, so we can apply one logic or we can apply another logic either or.\",

necessary for discussion.', 'We can hardly imagine any other.', 'Except from the current situation we need.', 'To choose one of these two different logical approaches and follow that logic as we organise the work of this session.', 'As regards the second question.', 'I will repeat in response to what was stated by the Austrian delegation.', 'We consider it to be very challenging to move on to the discussion of substantive issues before we have completed discussion of the Organization of work of the session.', \"You can't start the work of a session without having a shared understanding of how that work will be organised.\", 'Including the possibility of statements by non governmental entities.', 'Where we start the substantive discussions and suddenly some non governmental entity starts to speak.', 'At the plenary session.', 'No, we need to be clear.', 'We need to register the decision on the proposals on statements by non governmental entities during the plenary session, as we already said, we have to register whether we have a consensus on this or not.', 'So far we see no such consensus.', 'To start the substantive discussion without reaching agreement on basic questions is impossible because it would expose us to undermining the work.', 'If there were collisions which the Austrian delegation himself mentioned.', 'We would like to avoid that situation as we are totally not interested in undermining the work of the OWHE and we hope that all delegations, including the Austrian delegation, are not interested in undermining the work of the group also and they are submitting contradictory proposals in our opinion.', 'Thank you.', 'Now consolidated subviews questions.', 'Speaker 4\\nThank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you to you and the team from the secretariat for.', 'All the work.', 'That you have put in to prepare for this session, as you said at the beginning, we are reaching A crucial stage in our work where we have to start making recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles and as such.', \"That we're looking forward very much to the discussions this week, building on what has been, as you said, a very constructive atmosphere so far in.\", 'Work.', 'My delegation has absolutely no difficulty with the indicative timetable you have proposed.', 'As you say, it is an indicative timetable.', 'It is simply a proposal to structure our work.', 'We have to structure it somehow and we think this is as good as as as any way of doing that.', 'We will also note that.', 'See within the 10 topics you have proposed, ample scope for any delegation to raise anything it deems relevant to agenda item 6C.', \"The delegates to the Russian Federation appeal to the title of the resolution on reducing space threats and and of course, that's absolutely appropriate.\", 'I would also note, of course, that agenda item 6C and the reference to space systems also comes from the resolution.', \"So we we we need to decide whether we're sticking to the text of the resolution or not.\", 'But my my delegation certainly has has no difficulty with the timetable you have proposed.', 'On the other question just raised that of the participation by observer delegations, we did have a discussion about this last meeting.', \"I don't think partly what was just said that we.\", 'Did actually reach a conclusion on that we reached a a an accommodation that would allow us to continue our work without further disruption.', 'But if this question is going to come up again then of course we need to adhere to the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, but also the established practice of the General Assembly.', 'Again, as is very clearly.', 'Set out in the resolution resolutions of the General Assembly.', 'Give certain organisations the right to participate in the work of the General Assembly.', 'As observers permit.', 'Right.', 'The established practice of the General Assembly as set out, for example in the delegates handbook, gives those organisations the recognises that that those organisations participate by speaking in formal sessions of the of the GA.', 'This body is a subsidiary body of the GA.', \"We are bound by the GA's rules.\", 'Procedure and by its established practice, and we would certainly defend the right of those permanent observer organisations to speak in the formal work of the session, as they do in the General Assembly and, as they have done in other open-ended working groups, in the disarmament sphere.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.', 'We seem to have spent an awful lot of time this morning discussing a document which is not actually up for adoption or discussion, and which is simply meant to be a a planning tool to help us all structure what is quite a complicated discussion, if any delegation wanted to undermine.', 'The work of this group that would be a. Very effective way of doing it.', 'It I would suggest simply that if you that we proceed with our substantive work.', \"If the chair wants to suggest to delegates that they concentrate their statements on a particular issue, that is your prerogative as chair, it is every delegation's prerogative as a delegation to raise any issue it likes to be guided by that suggestion or not.\", 'So I would suggest that we proceed on that basis and if you would like to.', 'Offer us some guidance for our consideration.', \"Then we are free to take that or not, but we can't carry on going round in circles as one delegation seems to be determined to make us do on the question of the rights of delegations to speak.\", 'I can do no better than to reiterate what my Austrian colleague just said.', 'We will deal with the question when it arises, and if you have to make.', 'A rule and Mr. Chair.', 'Speaker 5\\nWe we would.', 'But yeah.', 'Let me just start out by saying that the Canadian delegation has the utmost faith in your leadership and guidance.', \"You've done an excellent job over the first two sessions of the OWG, including preparing indicative timetables for both of those sessions, which have resulted in very productive work and Canada.\", \"Has faced that the timetable, the indicative timetable that you've prepared for this session would equally result in.\", 'Productive outcomes should we apply it flexibly with respect to the proposal to change or add topics?', 'One point of clarification would be whether we would be substituting these two new topics in or adding them to the existing list of topics which would bring us to 12 topics.', 'Over the five days, which seems like it.', 'Would be a bit much.', \"The second thing I would note is one that you've already noted in many delegations themselves noted that this is a flexible indicative timetable.\", \"States are free to discuss the issues they want under these topics and any issues they want, and I'm certain they will do so when they want to.\", \"That won't.\", 'Be a problem.', 'But should there be any questions about adding new or arranged topics, I would simply note.', 'Topics 2 and three could easily be used to accommodate questions or or statements regarding norms for the prevention of placements of weapons in outer space.', \"I don't think there's really any need to alter them, but if they needed to be altered in some way, that's where this discussion could take place.\", 'It would easily fit under there.', 'Secondly, with respect to.', 'Prevention of use of force against weapons.', 'I think the topic 4 probably covers that already.', 'As written.', 'I mean if we need to amend it in any way, we could simply.', 'Amended to say norms, rules and principles relating to outer space, objects or activities that should enjoy protection.', 'From the use of force or something to that matter, but it seems like that topic already contemplates the suggestion.', 'So from our point of view, this indicative timetable is fine.', \"It's flexible states can raise what they want the the two particular issues that were raised by the delegation of the Russian Federation can easily be accommodated in topics 2-3 and four without upsetting the timetable.\", 'Or adding additional new topics could cause us to.', 'Run through our.', 'Work.', 'I think that would be an easy way of handling this with respect to the issue of parts.', \"Patient, I feel it's a mischaracterization to say there's no consensus on participation.\", \"It's actually the reverse.\", 'We have established rules of practice about the participation of observers.', 'We have resolution 76 slash 231, which once again explains what participation is.', \"I think it's more accurate to say there is no consensus to change the established.\", 'And since there is no consensus to change the established practice, we should proceed as is and get to the.', 'Substantive part of our work.', 'Without spending any more time on this particular issue because this is not a form where we can change the established rules of General Assembly resolution practices.', 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.', 'Speaker 6\\nAlong the lines.', 'Of of what was just stated by the by.', 'We are very comfortable with the indicative timetable that you have put.', 'Note that this does not prevent any delegation from raising relevant issues at any time with respect to the participation of the intergovernmental.', 'Organizations and other entities.', 'Our view is that they have a standing invitation to participate as observers in the work of the General Assembly.', 'As well as organizations and bodies of the United Nations, and with the attendance of other international organizations, commercial actors and civil society representatives, in accordance with established practice.', 'The IRS, ICRC has a standing invitation to participate in the GO.', 'As an observer, they were granted this status and General Assembly resolution 49 slash 2 adopted in 1994.', 'Accordingly, there should be no question regarding their participation in this body, whether in formal or informal session, as their right to participate was clearly set forth in the in the original resolution.', \"Moreover, some of these organizations plainly have expertise relevant to this body's work, and any attempts to exclude them.\", 'And participating in our work are cynical, groundless, and contrary to established practice.', 'Thank you, chair.', 'Thank you, chair.', 'I would like to support the Canadian statement and I would note.', \"On the latter point, and there's plenty.\", 'Of room to take up.', 'Issues that the Russian Federation would like to take up.', \"Unfortunately, we are now about two hours short of taking up some of those issues because we've wasted so much time on procedural issues and this is a a good example of trying to use the consensus.\", 'Principle to to interfere with regular procedures that allow us to do our work instead of getting down to the substance of things we all understand that any final decisions, consensus decisions on substance do need to be taken by consensus.', \"But that's not the same thing as as as having discussions and then on the on the latter point.\", 'Again, if this is a a UN General Assembly practice, then if if Russia wishes to do so, it it should take that that proposal to the UN General Assembly to get a a ruling on what constitutes an acceptable intergovernmental organization.', 'Thank you.', 'Chair on the organizational point just raised by our Austrian colleague, I would suggest that there must be a list of of the organizations that are participated in any number of meetings and that that would could be used as a way to establish just what established practice consists of.', \"So that's something that was accepted.\", 'In the past, should probably continue to be accepted now on the first point, I think we would object to the idea of of setting aside separate separate time slots for the proposals raised by 1 delegation.', 'On simply on the behalf of one single delegation, I would suggest there might be a way then to to slightly change the wording of some of the existing headings in a way that allows the the the the subjects that that the Russian Federation wishes to raise to be included in those topics.', \"But I don't think that it is appropriate for one delegation to come to this meeting and demand that the the timetable will be changed completely in order to accommodate its own parochial interest.\", 'Thank you.', 'Speaker 7\\nThe United Kingdom.', 'Out we would.', 'Thank you, Mr. Chair, also from our side as we speak for.', 'The first time.', 'We want to assure you of our full support for.', 'The conduct of this meeting and the constructive discussions.', 'On the two.', 'Procedural items that have been brought up now this morning, first on the participation of non governmental actors in particular.', 'The ICRC we are of a similar position as others that have spoken before us.', 'There has not only been a standing invitation through the resolution itself, that was very clear that they could participate as observers in the work of the of the General Assembly.', 'In accordance with established practice, our research has shown this this practice has been established several times in different working groups in.', 'The field of.', 'Disarmament and non proliferation.', \"So there's not much question on on that regard.\", \"In addition, there's many have pointed out there is also the.\", 'Resolution of 19. 90', 'Who grants the ICRC a very special.', 'Status and there is a Third Point that is.', 'Quite important here.', 'That we are.', 'Working here as the UK has pointed out.', 'Under the rules of the Gen. Assembly it is not up to us to change those rules.', 'Therefore there is also no consensus rule on lack of consensus that could affect those rules.', 'So we can continue under those rules as they are at the moment, and this is the way this meeting should be conducted.', 'The second point about the indicative timetable.', 'From our point of view, this also follows the logic of our previous meetings, the 1st and the second session that we had followed the the logic and the structure of the resolution under its Article 5.', \"On the ABCD, we are currently under the Point C. If we follow this logic and therefore it's quite clear that we should work under the title that you have given you had given the the today's meetings or that the indicative timetable more or less has given this meeting on the topics themselves.\", \"We think it's a very good choice we can fully support the different topics that are here, but it's also, as the UK has done, quite important to point out that this is only an indicative time.\", \"People, there's a lot of flexibility, a lot of scope.\", 'What we can talk about under the different topics that are here also, we ourselves might need to be flexible and maybe speak on a later stage this week on earlier topics.', \"So we don't see this as something that binds us or that is complicated or pose any problems so.\", \"Therefore, full support also from our side on all the topics given, and we will use them flexibly, and there's a constructive impact from from your side on how.\", 'To proceed, I thank you.', 'As we see it, the scope is.', 'It will be.', 'Do we also need to proceed?', 'We need to get.', 'To the substantive part of our work.', \"We don't see a need to register that there is no consensus as we've explained previously, this is not something that actually matters.\", 'We should proceed now.', 'And when it comes to the point of time, when we have the situation where an observer request to speak, I think you will have to make a decision and then in the case of objections, through a point of order or anything like that, the ruling on that matter and I think this should be the proper way to conduct the meeting.', 'This point on.', 'And on the 2nd letter that we discussed indicative timetable.', 'We have no particular problem with changing it and maybe this should also be something under your capacity that you could propose a new indicative timetable as you did with the first one.', 'We just note that that the topic.', 'Of prevention of an arms race in outer space.', 'Is already included under agenda item 6C at the title as a whole, so it is an overarching theme that probably could be wrapped up under all the topics that you have chosen here at the same time, we have no objection with including such a topic as a particular item somewhere in the text.', 'But we think that this should be.', 'Also, under your discretion, I thank you.', 'Speaker 8\\nThank you, chair.', 'This is my first time to speak at this working group.', 'Please allow me on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to express support to your work.', 'There will be other delegations Chinese ready.', 'To participate in the debates in a constructive manner.', 'And we promote progress in our debates.', 'On the issues raised by the Russian colleague.', 'Especially can participate in our work.', 'I remember that during the second session we discussed this issue.', 'I carefully listened to the statement by the Russian delegate a moment ago.', 'I understand that he refers to all angels rather than any single

work.', 'It is known indicative document.', 'All states can put forward their views on it.', 'Different states hold different views on what topics we should discuss.', 'This is quite normal.', 'We should hold an open and impressive approach.', 'Just need the Russian colleagues raised 2 new topics.', 'Is the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space.', 'The placement of weapons in outer space.', 'The 2nd is on the prevention of abuse or threat of use of force in outer space.', 'These two issues are very important to us.', 'Therefore, I propose that we give a consideration to these proposals from the Russian delegate.', 'Thank you.', 'Speaker 9\\nThank you very much.', 'Chair for all your work preparing us for this session.', 'My delegation fully supports your proposed approach.', \"I'll take the floor to add my voice to comments made by the UK, the US and France regarding formal participation in this meeting by observer delegations under Resolution 76/23.\", 'One which created this open-ended working group is clear.', 'It invited participation of intergovernmental organizations and other entities, having received a standing invitation to participate as

far since I am the last speaker on this issue and I waited until to see what is happening.', 'Actually we have two point to make one.', 'First and foremost is regarding the timetable, of course, so many delegation have supported the timetable.', 'They are right that it could give some flexibility, but so far as the timetable is concerned and its relation.', 'With the summary that you have prepared as well as the possible element on the items of the recommendations concerned, we do not see that the timetable is exactly the one that could bring us to the issue that.', 'Ultimately, as everybody is suggesting that take us to the discussion of legal binding document, because in our view, as we have addressed that in our working paper in in the last meeting as well as the statement that we have made.', 'It seems to us that the possible elements on the nerves and possible rules has been taken for granted so far as this issue is concerned, and the mandate and the name of this open-ended working group, although it has come.', 'From the title of the resolution, we should so far should remind that the resolution has not been adopted unanimously so far.', 'You are, I think, quite aware of this issue.', 'That so many countries have adopted have weighted negatively and some.', \"That's necessarily our new means that this concept of responsible behavior that take us to norms and rules means that for consideration of the root of their country that they are yet contending on the approach in our understanding there are two approaches.\", 'Of course, those who have given positive votes are favoring of soft law as.', 'I think very eloquently the Chinese.', 'People has addressed that issue.', 'But this issue of norms and possible norms should not be taken for granted that we should work on that basis.', 'Fortunately or unfortunately, the two paper that you have prepared has been prepared on the assumptions that this issue of norms, possible loans and so on.', 'Being adopted so far as the issue is concerned, even seems possible norms.', 'Therefore, it might be no possible norms to follow ultimately.', 'Therefore, I should remind that, for my delegation and some other delegation, this approach of possible means is not the way that ultimately end us to the to the result, so far as these two contending approach are yet in the discussion of this open.', 'In that working group.', \"And unfortunately, since the city has not been able and the issue of the Paris as a legal binding document has not been negotiated so far in the in the city, we don't think that this issue of norms and possible norms could be substituted to legal binding.\", 'Document.', \"I don't want to prolong my.\", 'My intervention here, but just I wanted to remind to the distinguished that in order to keep the balance between the two approaches, I I think that the approach of those that are not favoring the possible loans should be also taken into account by the distinguished share.', 'And any paper that is prepared by the church should keep.', 'The balance so.', 'And well, as far as we have examined those two, we see that the of course the legal binding document has been reflected in the Chair.', 'But this approach that I am saying, the approach of those that are favoring the legal binding documents and do not see the norms and possible norms as a substitute.', 'Illegal binding document should be also taken in any paper that you prepare.', 'What I see is that is very tall.', 'Reflection of the second approach, and I humbly request you, Mr. Chair, that any paper that you prepare, you consider that these two approaches are yet should be discussed and the approach of those who have voted positively.', 'Of course, the large number have given voted positively.', 'But it should not be taken for granted, because here we are working on the basis of consensus and until and unless the the controversy between the two two approaches should not be solved, it is impossible to decide on this issue.', 'Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.', 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.', 'Since this is the first time for my delegation to take the floor, allow me to thank you again for the excellent work that you have been doing in stealing the work of this group.', 'I would like to make three points.', 'First, the Philippines supports the timetable that you have
